                <h2>Memory Lane</h2>
                <p>Divya, do you remember the first day we met in 5th standard? We were just kids then, but somehow, we clicked instantly. From sharing tiffins to sharing secrets, our friendship grew stronger every day. Those school days were full of fun and laughter. We were inseparable, like two peas in a pod.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Message from the Heart</h2>
                <p>Dear Divya,</p>
                <p>I can't believe how much time has flown by. It feels like just yesterday we were laughing and making memories in school. I'm so grateful we reconnected after those 7 long years. You mean the world to me, and I regret that we've drifted apart again.</p>
                <p>I want you to know that I miss you a lot. The distance and silence between us have been hard for me, and I sincerely apologize for not being in touch as much as I should have been. You deserve better, and I promise to make more effort to stay connected.</p>
                <p>You are an incredible person, and I am lucky to have you in my life. Let's make sure our bond stays strong, no matter the distance.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Wishes and Future Plans</h2>
                <p>Happy Birthday, Divya!</p>
                <p>I hope your day is filled with joy, laughter, and all the things you love. Let's make a promise to each other to stay in touch more often. How about we plan regular video calls or virtual movie nights? Maybe we can even plan a trip together sometime soon!</p>
                <p>Here's to many more years of friendship, memories, and adventures. I miss you and can't wait to catch up properly.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With love and warm wishes,</p>
                <p>Andy</p>
