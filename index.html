        <h2>Memory Lane</h2>
        <p>Divya, do you remember the first day we met in 5th standard? We were just kids then, but somehow, we clicked instantly. From sharing tiffins to sharing secrets, our friendship grew stronger every day. Those school days were full of fun and laughter. We were inseparable, like two peas in a pod.</p>

        <h2>Poem for You</h2>
        <p>Divya meri yaar, tu hai sabse pyaari,<br>
        5th standard mein hui thi hamari mulakaat nihari.<br>
        Saath guzare humne kitne saal,<br>
        Fir aayi doori, dil ho gaya kamaal.<br><br>
        7 saal baad, tujhe phir se paaya,<br>
        Dil ki baat keh di, tujhse saath nibhaya.<br>
        Ab hai phir se doori, baatein kam hoti hain,<br>
        Par yaadein teri, har din raat roti hain.<br><br>
        Hinglish mein bolu toh, tu hai meri jaan,<br>
        Maafi maangta hu, hum kyu ho gaye anjaan.<br>
        Teri kami mehsoos hoti hai har din,<br>
        Tere saath ke bina, life lagti thin.<br><br>
        Happy birthday Divya, tujhse maafi maangta hu,<br>
        Apni galtiyon ke liye, tujhse sach mein sharminda hu.<br>
        Dosti humari fir se rang laaye,<br>
        Har pal mein tujhse baat kar paaye.</p>

        <h2>Message from the Heart</h2>
        <p>Dear Divya,<br><br>
        I can't believe how much time has flown by. It feels like just yesterday we were laughing and making memories in school. I'm so grateful we reconnected after those 7 long years. You mean the world to me, and I regret that we've drifted apart again.<br><br>
        I want you to know that I miss you a lot. The distance and silence between us have been hard for me, and I sincerely apologize for not being in touch as much as I should have been. You deserve better, and I promise to make more effort to stay connected.<br><br>
        You are an incredible person, and I am lucky to have you in my life. Let's make sure our bond stays strong, no matter the distance.<br><br>
        Happy birthday, Divya! I hope this day is as special as you are.<br><br>
        With all my love and best wishes,<br>
        [Your Name]</p>

        I hope your day is filled with joy, laughter, and all the things you love. Let's make a promise to each other to stay in touch more often. How about we plan regular video calls or virtual movie nights? Maybe we can even plan a trip together sometime soon!<br><br>
        Here's to many more years of friendship, memories, and adventures. I miss you and can't wait to catch up properly.<br><br>
