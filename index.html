                <h2>Memory Lane</h2>
                <p>Divya, do you remember the first day we met in 5th standard? We were just kids then, but somehow, we clicked instantly. From sharing tiffins to gossping, our friendship grew stronger every day. Those school days were full of fun and laughter. We were inseparable,.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Message from the Heart</h2>
                <p>Dear Divya,</p>
                <p>I can't believe how much time has flown by. It feels like just yesterday we were laughing and making memories in school. I'm so grateful we reconnected after those 7 long years. You mean the world to me, and I regret that we've drifted apart again.</p>
                <p>I want you to know that I miss you a lot. The distance and silence between us have been hard for me, and I sincerely apologize for not being in touch as much as I should have been. You deserve better, and I promise to make more effort to stay connected.</p>
                <p>You are an incredible person, and I am lucky to have you in my life. Let's make sure our bond stays strong, no matter the distance.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Wishes and Future Plans</h2>
                <p>Happy Birthday, Divya!</p>
                <p>I hope your day is filled with joy, laughter, and all the things you love. Let's make a promise to each other to stay in touch more often. by missing each other more often. Arey mazak kr raha üòÇ ! but seriously hope you're doin well and great</p>
                <br>
                <p>With love and warm wishes,</p>
                <p> aur jaate arz kiya hai, 
                    Divya meri yaar, tum ho sabse pyaari,
                    5th standard mein hui thi hamari mulakaat nihari.
                    Saath guzare humne kitne saal,
                    Fir aayi doori, dil ho gaya kamaal.
                    
                    7 saal baad, tumhe phir se paaya,
                    Dil ki baat keh di, tumse saath nibhaya.
                    Ab hai phir se doori, baatein kam hoti hain,
                    Par yaadein teri, har din raat roti hain.
                    
                    agar mein bolu toh, tum ho ek alag hi pechaan,
                    Maafi maangta hu, hum kyu ho gaye anjaan.
                    Teri kami mehsoos hoti hai har din,
                    Tere saath ke bina, life lagti thin.
                    
                    Happy birthday Divya, tumse maafi maangta hu,
                    Apni galtiyon ke liye, tumhse sach mein sharminda hu.
                    Dosti humari fir se rang laaye,
                    Har pal mein tujhse baat kar paaye.
                <p> Your Andy</p>
